\subsection*{Abstract}
\vspace{-9pt}
We propose a fully automatic stream management technique, called {\sf PCStream}, 
for multi-streamed SSDs.
{\sf PCStream} is based on our observation that data lifetimes can be reliably predicted using
write program contexts.  
By extracting program contexts during runtime,  
{\sf PCStream}  automates the data-to-stream mapping.  
When data mapped to the same
stream show large differences in their lifetimes, {\sf PCStream}
moves the long-lived data of the current stream to 
its substream during garbage collection.
Our experimental results 
show that {\sf PCStream} 
can reduce the garbage collection overhead as much as a highly-optimized 
manual stream management technique 
while no code modification is necessary.
