\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented a new fully automatic stream management technique,
called PCStream, which can improve the accuracy of data separation
using the application level information.
In the modern append-only workload, since the hotness of data is regardless of 
the its address, 
LBA-based existing automatic stream management technique have limitations on 
identifying the hotness of data.
PCStream was motivated by our observation that data lifetimes can be
reliably predicted using write program contexts which is from the higher
abstraction level than LBAs.
By allocating the identified PCs into streams according to the mapping policy,
PCStream can separate different lifetime data. 
For some PCs showing various lifetime, PCStream moves the long-lived data of 
current stream to its substream during the garbage collection.
Experimental result showed that PCStream reduces WAF by 40\% over the existing
automatic technique.
