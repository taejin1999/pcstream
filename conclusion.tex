\section{Conclusions}
We have presented a new stream management technique, {\sf PCStream}, for multi-streamed SSDs.  
Unlike existing stream management techniques, {\sf PCStream} fully automates 
the process of mapping data to a stream based on PCs, 
which work well for append-only workloads as well as update workloads.  
By exploiting an observation that most PCs are distinguishable from each other 
in their lifetime characteristics, {\sf PCStream} allocates each PC to a different stream.  
When a PC has a large variance in their lifetimes, {\sf PCStream} refines its stream allocation 
during garbage collection and moves the long-lived data of the current stream to its substream.  
Our experimental results show that {\sf PCStream} can reduce WAF by up to 38\% over the existing
automatic technique.

The current version of {\sf PCStream} can be extended in several directions.  
For example, {\sf PCStream} should be improved in its PC clustering method 
so that it can work effectively even when there are more PCs than the number of streams.  
We also plan to evaluate {\sf PCStream} (not {\sf PCStream}$^{--}$) on real SSDs 
by implementing the two-phase stream assignment algorithm inside an FTL.
